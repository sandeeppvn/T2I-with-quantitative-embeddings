### Steps to reproduce the code

- Step 1: Run the notebook. This notebook will work only on Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C9wzPjyYUb0mOiuDlVCS8l86TsaQBdsD](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C9wzPjyYUb0mOiuDlVCS8l86TsaQBdsD)

- Step2:  Run the script `dataset_curation_part1.py` . To do this ; the dataset needs to be downloaded from this link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FhQARl68A9NjjIbpQ6ib28UQ6pcLUSXJ?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FhQARl68A9NjjIbpQ6ib28UQ6pcLUSXJ?usp=sharing)
    - Out of the Step 1 is used in this python file
    - And the path for animal images needs to be changed to the path of `animal_images` folder in your local.  Code line 53.
    
    ```python
    #this neeeds to be replaced with the path where the images are saved 
    destination = '/Volumes/GoogleDrive/Shared drives/MSML612 DeepLearningProject/data/animal_images'
    ```
